# DartboardOptimisation
This will yield the optimal area to aim at when throwing darts for the best average scoring

We generate $N$ random points that are normally distributed, then we assign the score to each and calculate the average. :)
The circle you draw is there 99% of the darts will land in.
The score is determined by the colour of the segment the dart is in.
